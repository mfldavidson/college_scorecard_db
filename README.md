# College Scorecard Database
#### _Final project for [SI 564](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/courses/564) Winter 2020_

I created a database using (some of) the 2014-15 US Department of Education College Scorecard data.
This data was sourced from [the US Department of Education](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) 
on March 7, 2020. I used the data in the database to answer questions using SQL queries.

The questions I posed for myself to answer were:

1. Which city has the most institutions, and how many does it have? If there is a tie, I only need to see one.
1. What are the average earnings for each control?
1. What is the average cost and average family income for each level?
1. Which region has the highest average share of first generation students attending its institutions? Which has the lowest? Please include the share of first generation students as well with each.
1. Which institution has the largest share of first generation students? Please give me the share as well as the institutionâ€™s name, city, state (abbreviated), region, control, level, mean earnings, completion rate, and mean cost. If there is a tie, I only need to see one.
1. Which institutional control has the highest mean family income, and what is that income? How much higher is it than the next closest?
1. Which region has the largest share of private for-profit institutions (compared to other types of controls)?
1. Please give me the name, city, and state (full name, not abbreviated) of the top 5 institutions by mean earnings which also meet the following criteria:
    - Over 50% first generation students
    - Mean cost is less than $10,000
1. Please give me the name and level of the 5 institutions with the highest mean cost.
1. Which region has the highest mean earnings? Which state?
